Compile all these files: main.cpp LinkedList.cpp Node.cpp OrderedCollection.cpp Set.cpp SetAsList.cpp SetAsOC.cpp 
You can also use the Makefile in this folder
Once the program is compiled and run, the following commands can be entered in the command line interface (as in the specification):

o 	initialize the sets as OrderedCollections
e 	erase set A
s 	switch sets
c 	copy content of set A into set B
